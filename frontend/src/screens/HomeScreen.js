          <h3>1. Don't Repeat Yourself</h3>
          <p>
            Don‚Äôt repeat yourself (
            <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DRY</code>)
            is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition
            of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions or using data
            normalization to avoid redundancy.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a general rule, if you find yourself copying and pasting code, or
            repeating it in a similar manner, don‚Äôt do that. Either create a{" "}
            <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
              Function
            </code>
            , a{" "}
            <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Class</code>,
            a{" "}
            <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Module</code>
            , or some kind of{" "}
            <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
              Abstraction
            </code>
            .
          </p>
          <h3>2. keep it simple. Stupid!</h3>
          <p>
            <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">KISS</code>,
            an acronym for ‚Äúkeep it simple, stupid‚Äù, is a design principle noted
            by the U.S. Navy in 1960. The KISS principle states that most
            systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made
            complicated; therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design,
            and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.
          </p>
          <p>
            We always recommend you to look for the most simple and succinct way
            of doing something, rather than doing something complex or writing
            tons of lines of code that can be summarized in just a small number
            of lines.
          </p>
          <p>
            This principle should not conflict with the first one, sometimes a
            feature would only be used once, therefore an abstraction won‚Äôt be
            needed, and sometimes the feature would be used multiple times, then
            the first principle applies in that case.
          </p>
          <h3> Quality over quantity.</h3>
          <p>
            We don‚Äôt care if you write a lot of lines of code, that‚Äôs not an
            indicator of hard work, we rather prefer a{" "}
            <code className="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
              quality code
            </code>{" "}
            that resolves the problems while being concise.
          </p>
          <h4>Example:</h4>
        </div>

        <Terminal />
        <blockquote className={`${padding}`}>
          <p>
            <strong>Note</strong> that a good code is self-documenting, in the
            first method the comment was required because the name of the method
            didn‚Äôt inform what it does, in the Good code the method itself
            informs that it returns the factorial of a number, and it also
            accomplishes the same in a single line of code.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote className={`${padding}`}>
          <p>
            <strong>However</strong>, it doesn‚Äôt mean all the code should not be
            documented, documentation is important and required in a lot of
            cases.
          </p>
